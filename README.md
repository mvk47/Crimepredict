# Crimepredict
To predict a crime type and dispatch forces accordingly.
We had a dataset of the Cincinnati crime data with 40 columns having variables like Incident ID, Date reported, Date To, Date from, Closed duration, UCR group, Offense type, Zipcode, Victim Gender, Victim Race, Suspect Race, Suspect Gender, Weapons.
We cleaned the data as it had many unwanted categories and processed the data with meaningful variables to work on.
Our final dataset has 32 columns with variables that are required to predict a crime type in a particular zipcode and dispatch forces accordingly.
We made various plots like the L_code vs offense,Month vs offense, Month vs UCR group, Day of week vs offense, Day of week vs UCR group, count of clsd_des vs the offense type to get a visual sense of the data.
We made a Heatmap to show the most affected areas in the Cincinnati region.
We made use of Supervised learning and plotted a Decision tree to show the Closed_code and the UCR group rules that are factors for the crime data predictions.
We made a logistic regression that predicted the most affected areas in the Cincinnati region.
We plotted a Time vs Crime Barplot to see at what time of the day the crimes are mostly committed.
We also anaylsed which areas are mostly affected as per the crime data analysis.
